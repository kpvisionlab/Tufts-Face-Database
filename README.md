# Tufts-Face-Database
## Multi-modal face  images (112 participants, &gt;100,000 images in total)
## 7 image modalities: visible, near-infrared, thermal, computerized sketch, video, LYTRO and 3D images

### Context

Tufts Face Database is the most comprehensive, large-scale (over 10,000 images, 74 females + 38 males, from more than 15 countries with an age range between 4 to 70 years old) face dataset that contains 7 image modalities: visible, near-infrared, thermal, computerized sketch, LYTRO, recorded video, and 3D images. This webpage/dataset contains the Tufts Face Database three-dimensional (3D) images. The other datasets are made available through separate links by the user.

Cross-modality face recognition is an emerging topic due to the wide-spread usage of different sensors in day-to-day life applications. The development of face recognition systems relies greatly on existing databases for evaluation and obtaining training examples for data-hungry machine learning algorithms. However, currently, there is no publicly available face database that includes more than two modalities for the same subject. In this work, we introduce the Tufts Face Database that includes images acquired in various modalities: photograph images, thermal images, near infrared images, a recorded video, a computerized facial sketch, and 3D images of each volunteer’s face. An Institutional Research Board protocol was obtained, and images were collected from students, staff, faculty, and their family members at Tufts University. 

This database will be available to researchers worldwide in order to benchmark facial recognition algorithms for sketch, thermal, NIR, 3D face recognition and heterogamous face recognition.

### Image Acquisition

Each participant was seated in front of a blue background in close proximity to the camera. The cameras were mounted on tripods and the height of each camera was adjusted manually to correspond to the image center. The distance to the participant was strictly controlled during the acquisition process. A constant lighting condition was maintained using diffused lights. 

TD_CS: Computerized facial sketches were generated using software FACES 4.0 [1], one of the most widely used software packages by law enforcement agencies, the FBI, and the US Military. The software allows researchers to choose a set of candidate facial components from the database based on their observation or memory. 

TD_3D: The images were captured using a quad camera (an array of 4 cameras). Each individual was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the cameras were moved to 9 equidistant positions forming an approximate semi-circle around the individual. The 3D models were reconstructed using open-source structure-from-motion algorithms.

TD_IR_E(E stands for expression/emotion): The images were captured using a FLIR Vue Pro camera. Each participant was asked to pose with (1) a neutral expression, (2) a smile, (3) eyes closed, (4) exaggerated shocked expression, (5) sunglasses. 

TD_IR_A (A stands for around):  The images were captured using a FLIR Vue Pro camera. Each participant was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the cameras were moved to 9 equidistant positions forming an approximate semi-circle around the participant .

TD_RGB_E: The images were captured using a NIKON D3100 camera. Each participant was asked to pose with (1) a neutral expression, (2) a smile, (3) eyes closed, (4) exaggerated shocked expression, (5) sunglasses. 

TD_RGB_A: The images were captured using a quad camera (an array of 4 visible field cameras). Each participant was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the cameras were moved to 9 equidistant positions forming an approximate semi-circle around the participant.

TD_NIR_A: The images were captured using a quad camera (an array of 4 night vision cameras). The lighting condition for NIR imaging was maintained by using an 850nm Infrared 96 LED light system. Each participant was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the cameras were moved to 9 equidistant positions forming an approximate semi-circle around the participant.

TD_LYT_A: The images were captured using a LYTRO ILLUM 40 Megaray Light Field camera. Each participant was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the cameras were moved to 9 equidistant positions forming an approximate semi-circle around the participant.

TD_VIDEO:  The images were captured using one of the visible field quad cameras. Each participant was asked to look at a fixed view-point while the camera was moved around the participant forming an approximate semi-circle.
